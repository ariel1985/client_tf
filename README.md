# Client_Translator (client-tf)

Client_Translator is a Quasar project designed to facilitate language translation within applications. It provides an interface for managing translations of different languages, including English, French, and Spanish.

The project includes a translation page (`TranslatePage.vue`) where users can add new translations, save them, and view them in a table format. The translations are stored in a local store (`store.js`), and the application watches for changes in the route parameters to fetch the relevant translations.
